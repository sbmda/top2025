1,bad bunny,DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS,"came out january 5th. instantly became a classic. i really doubt any other album on this list or any other list on the internet is more deserving of the title ""album of the year"" honestly. the cultural impact of it as well as the masterful way it was written and produced is just unparalleled. it has been a difficult year in music (mayhaps) but not for BAD BUNNY! pure art. i feel like we were so lucky to witness this release, and for us to consistently live it throughout the entirety of the year; experience it at various moments... it transcends time in a way very few albums do. te amo mucho benito gracias para todo <3 ",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/90/5e/7e/905e7ed5-a8fa-a8f3-cd06-0028fdf3afaa/199066342442.jpg
2,ino casablanca,extasia,"i discovered ino casablanca through a friend who first linked me to <em>albufeira</em> in mid-2025. and then came october, and he dropped what probably is the album i danced the most to all year. wow! but the beauty of <em>extasia</em> goes even beyond its (stellar) composition; it's in the fun and witty writing and the wonderful cohesion we rarely hear nowadays in albums such as these. it's so so so good and doesn't fall into tackiness at all to me; it's perfect in the way it follows straight into the influences it takes from, reinvents it all, and doesn't caricature any of it. easily top 3 albums of the year... merci pour tout ino sincèrement.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/a9/dd/5d/a9dd5dce-8926-fe8f-a37e-8a99c9a4142e/5026854040271.jpg
3,day6,the decade,"is it the best album of the year? no. is it the best k-pop album of the year? not even sure honestly. but it's day6, it has songs on there that reminded me exactly of where my deep love and appreciation for this group comes from, and it came at such an incredible time (i was in korea!) it just left that much of an impact on me. yes, they do have better albums of theirs in their own discography. yes, it does fall short of being cohesive enough, especially as a ten-year anniversary album. but their standard is often some other groups' peak in my eyes, and maybe their place in here is completely motivated by my own personal love of the band. who cares? ",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/93/9f/05/939f0563-96d1-42df-a9ec-23ecc857eec6/8809928954691_Cover.jpg
4,milo j,la vida era más corta,"it's one of those albums i added to my library a little bit by chance; i'd known milo j through <em>i am</em> and subsequently enjoyed the album it appeared on. but this? nothing could have prepared me for this. one of the most underrated records of the year, though i suppose it's one of those that you just need to know exists before you dive in and truly Listen. it's crazy to think this guy was like, 18 years old when he wrote most of this. there is something to be said about this year's trend towards cultural reconnection and reappropriation, and this one is one of the best, most well-executed examples of it.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/f5/a6/33/f5a63325-8bd8-7e36-8850-878e2522169e/196873615486.jpg
5,theodora,mega bbl,"i'm cheating a little bit. i know. this is a reedition of <em>bad boy lovestory</em>, which came out in (late) 2024 and i have been obsessed with since its release. but the way it was restructured, changing up the tracklist entirely in order to add new songs—and the way those new songs then interact with the previous ones on the record... masterful. incredible. c'était écrit dans le ciel que theodora allait percer, mais ce fut un réel plaisir de la découvrir en profondeur sur <em>mega bbl</em>... i will forever regret missing not just one, but TWO of her performances in montreal. stp reviens vite ma reine je t'attends... <3",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/97/bf/ca/97bfca44-9e03-06cb-e0bb-65cc94e3d153/25UMGIM62999.rgb.jpg
6,yves,soft error: x,"<em>soft error</em> quickly became one of my favourite k-pop releases of the year. and then yves had to come and re-release it, adding one song to the tracklist. does that even qualify as a repackage these days? do idols still do that, anyway? i didn't think one song would make that much of a difference, honestly. but boy, i was wrong! i was so wrong. <em>ex machina</em> stands out beautifully on the rest of the already incredibly well executed tracklist. yves' team is so versatile with the way they approach songs, and her music quickly is making its way amongst my most listened to of the year... even if the lyrics are actually nonsensical. i'm sorry. but the BEAT! man i love k-pop sometimes.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/fc/e2/21/fce2218f-d698-556e-eb76-a01f61b49f68/5026854057170.jpg
7,xdinary heroes,beautiful mind,"i remember when xdh debuted and i... barely cared, really. RIP. and then, convinced by one of my friends at work to check them out, i fell hard for <em>troubleshooting</em> and <em>live and fall</em>... and then this came out. holy fucking shit. it quickly reminded me of what charmed me as a teen when it comes to good old pop rock and pop punk... <em>beautiful life</em> remains to me one of the coolest k-pop (if you can call it that) title track releases of the year. a rock opera song of over four minutes long? HELLO... ",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/8c/45/ce/8c45ce0c-7b2f-cdff-161d-f67528914b3c/8809928953236_Cover.jpg
8,"tyler, the creator",don't tap the glass,"a surprise album! i love those. they're fun and they are often well thought-out, sometimes much more than hyped-up releases (especially in the pop mainstream) that are teased months in advance before their release, only to fall short in retrospect. this was unexpected and fun and not much like <em>chromakopia</em> but felt like a perfect, dislocated sequel, yet also like a perfect, catchy standalone. it was just good, man. <em>like sugar on my... tongue...</em>",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/a0/ae/e6/a0aee657-b365-fed2-249c-0f22efa507d0/196873435435.jpg
9,rosalía,lux,"did not see it coming. did not expect it at all. who would've thought extensive musical knowledge, deep personal introspection, and religious imagery could come together to create such a crazy record... maybe this is what all albums should be. maybe we only need one of these once in a while. i'm not sure. but it was a delight to discover, even though i don't replay it often (it's not really the type of thing you play on shuffle, anyway). it still belongs on this list i think... for all these reasons.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/95/ae/80/95ae8046-a6b9-e493-0def-5ae33d63f43a/196873722672.jpg
10,nmixx,blue valentine,"i hesitated for a long time to pick between nmixx's two releases of the year... my favourite track of theirs of all time appears on the other one (<em>papillon</em> on <em>fe3o4: forward</em>... truly fucking insane track), but as a cohesive body of work i found that <em>blue valentine</em> definitely fit the bill more. it's so good! these girls are so talented and their songs don't shy away from exploring with complex percussion, synths, bass... my favourite k-pop recipe. which is why i had to choose at least of their albums for this list, and turns out, i don't get tired of looping this one. it's fun the entire way through. thank you girls!",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/a7/5d/54/a75d54db-b997-d410-b6dd-25f7e766392a/8809928955148_Cover.jpg
11,stray kids,karma,"you know what's funny? while working on this before <em>do it</em> came out, i debated for sooooo long about whether to include stray kids in this list (shocker right) simply because as insane as i have been listening to them this year, <em>karma</em> was... kind of far on my ranking at the time. not super far—i still overplayed <em>creed</em>, <em>phoenix</em>, <em>ghost</em>, <em>half-time</em>... wait that's like half the tracklist. OH! and then <em>do it</em> came out and almost made me reconsider putting <em>karma</em> on this list again (i nearly, nearly didn't). but i've been listening to it again, and after seeing my own apple music replay (which i will redo on my own, eventually), i've come to realize i really did enjoy this album. do i think stray kids can do better? yes—and they have, at least with <em>divine</em>. but is this album still incredibly fun and one of the few that got me excited? also yes. i cherish you, stray kids.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/38/22/ee/3822ee8e-c8f6-bb12-10ca-dcfd27dd166b/8809928955230_Cover.jpg
12,disiz,on s'en rappellera pas,"FUCK. holy fuck. i knew a new album by disiz would fuck me up, but then the man went and obliterated my expectations. i already loved <em>melodrama</em> so much (theodora ma reine fr fr), but it sounds even better in the whole, complete work that is <em>on s'en rappelera pas</em>. it's one of the rare ones on this list (and ever, this year anyway) that reads and listens as a long, winding story; not with set characters and whatnot but a consistent theme, a deep exploration of emotion and heartbreak, while remaining both sonically interesting and cohesive throughout. god i love this album so much. i want to be able to write just like the way this album sounds and feels. ",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/1f/49/0d/1f490dc9-1e4d-7a91-f25a-086566f406e6/196873642161.jpg
13,jade,that's showbiz baby!,"i really liked little mix back in the day... when one direction was all i had on my mind and little mix felt like their government-assigned sister girl group. i really enjoyed their music though, but then i lost sight of them and their career until jesy left the group (rip), and they went on hiatus not long after. and then, i watched as the whole of the internet raved over jade's solo album. generational, they called it. showstopping, something so rare nowadays. i thought, oh? so i checked it out (albeit very late, in october, SORRY) and i have to say—they were right. the internet was so right. it's fun, and it's a journey, and as long as it is (blessedly so), it doesn't get lost in an array of genres, trying to tap into every box of the current pop mainstream landscape—instead, it finds where jade's voice shines and excels and stays there, and does it wonderfully. it's so fucking good. i hate myself for taking forever to listen to it. jade really IS the IT girl.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/ee/25/ef/ee25ef48-9c5a-1899-cb2f-f3884bc5a15a/196873087917.jpg
14,karol g,tropicoqueta,"okay... so i did expect a bit more from karol g on this. there are a few missteps, too. HOWEVER, there are some gems on there that in my opinion make up for the rest. namely, <em>latina foreva</em> and <em>fkn movie</em> have gone platinum in my car, amongst others. and <em>viajando por el mundo</em> truly shocked me so much the first time i heard it that maybe <em>tropicoqueta</em> belongs here just for this. i can't lie though—i was a little disappointed. no, i didn't loop this album as much as i expected to. still good, though. i will continue to bump the shit out of <em>fkn movie</em> in my car for the months to come.",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/1e/39/f5/1e39f58c-e5c1-6431-d6ed-d6c32e29d63f/25UMGIM79234.rgb.jpg
15,kali uchis,"sincerely,","to me, <em>sincerely,</em> reads like a long, beautiful long letter. mellow throughout, but doesn't get boring. <em>it's just us</em> has lulled me to sleep, to quietude and peace, ever since it came out. it's hushed and beautiful and feels intimate, definitely is, too. like a carefully crafted gift that might have not been for our ears but was shared anyway, and i'm so thankful. it's not the kind of album i go back to often, maybe it has more to do with where i am in life and how it clashes a little with how potent in emotion this feels—but when i do allow myself to, it feels nice. ",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/32/cb/cd/32cbcd1f-ca12-df86-e3ed-8ef0f7ac09e9/25UMGIM43974.rgb.jpg
16,pinkpantheress,fancy some more?,"i had quite enjoyed <em>fancy that</em> when it first came out—i didn't know much more about pinkpantheress other than a general idea of her sound, and her obsession with nct's haechan. i liked the album, looped it a couple times. but then! she announced the reedition of it, comprised of remixes for every single song, as well as rerecorded, sometimes reimagined versions of those same songs, this time including features from a wide variety of artists. and that's exactly what got me—this desire for exploration, deconstruction and reimagination, of a body of work that was already decent enough, but now this time with the input and vision of other artists. it's so cool. <em>stars</em> on its own and <em>stars</em> with yves are two different songs, and i love that about them (i do prefer the yves version. it's just so good). it's the kind of approach that i love so much about music, and i cannot <em>not</em> applaud it. so well done!",https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/b0/d2/bb/b0d2bb76-41a2-1bb1-586c-107b63e4181d/5026854077819.jpg
