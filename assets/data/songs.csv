a1,bad bunny,VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,"SONG OF THE MOTHERFUCKING YEAR. listen. listeeeeennn. yes, there are better songs on <em>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</em>. songs that are longer, that are better produced, that tell a more impactful story. as we've established, the album is a feat in music and artistry like no other artist has even pretended to attain this year. but this song... it's so fucking catchy, it will put me in a good mood literally no matter how i feel, it makes me want to dance and sing and god i don't even know why i'm so hyped about what is quite literally just a simple reggaeton song but it's so good guys. it's crazy.",2:36,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/90/5e/7e/905e7ed5-a8fa-a8f3-cd06-0028fdf3afaa/199066342442.jpg
a2,ino casablanca,bissap du 20ème,"le nombre de fois que j'ai chanté cette chanson depuis sa sortie bro. <em>quitte à me mettre la mif à dos... j'traînais en bas chaque día...</em> it's the perfect balance of catchy, fun, and thoughtful; it's a stellar example of what a good raï song should be without falling into boring, redone clichés, that seem to gain a sick popularity these days. not that i don't eat it up sometimes—i'm a sucker for a good fucking beat!!!—but this feels so genuine and real. i love this song bro. FUCK",3:37,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/a9/dd/5d/a9dd5dce-8926-fe8f-a37e-8a99c9a4142e/5026854040271.jpg
a3,theodora & thisizlondon,masoko na mabele,"fuck i don't even know how to describe this song. it's addictive and it will make you shake your ass. i find theodora's music nearly bewitching with the way she embodies her persona through her songs, as well as the insane way her songs sound. thisizlondon is someone i discovered through this track and i'm already excited to hear more from him... and now we even have a music video for this song. god fucking bless. ",2:57,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/97/bf/ca/97bfca44-9e03-06cb-e0bb-65cc94e3d153/25UMGIM62999.rgb.jpg
a4,lou-adriane cassidy,dis-moi dis-moi dis-moi,"this song won chanson de l'année at this year's adisq gala. i usually rarely care for adisq as i find that the ""quebec"" culture it portrays is awfully limited and ridiculously fucking white, for a cultural landscape—especially in music—that has drastically changed in the past decades, in the past five years even more. but this song is actually stellar, and deserving of its praise. i find the rest of the album to fall a little short, as good as it remains, but this song? please listen to it. it's indie pop at its finest, it is so poignant, i love it so much. oh my god. i think it came out in 2024 technically but honestly i don't care. it belongs here.",5:10,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/90/ca/9e/90ca9ebf-6ff0-c6c1-1cb0-7a21107f43f7/cover.jpg
a5,stray kids,divine,"kim seungmin you are the vocalist of the century. non mais sans blague—i have to be honest, as much as i absolutely love skz, none of their releases up until that point, this year, had led me to believe they would ever drop something like <em>divine</em>. i think some of the best songs of theirs, this year and overall, are the ones where you can feel them taking risks, playing around with sounds and bending genres to the limits of their desires. and while some other tracks managed that on <em>karma</em> (my beautiful, beautiful <em>half-time</em>), i feel like <em>divine</em> did it SO well. i felt that the first moment i heard the song and it reminded me exactly of why i have been obsessed with this stupid band's music since the fucking pandemic and then again this year hello!!! i love this song!!!!!!",3:07,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/72/33/69/7233691c-aefe-252d-678b-faa9b3455200/8809928958965_Cover.jpg
a6,chappell roan,the subway,"they don't make songs like these anymore... you can belt it, you can silently weep to it, you can sing along as you drive home in the dead of the night some winter night, and it will always hit the same. chappell roan has such a hypnotic voice, and i absolutely love the way she writes. this song really shows exactly that, and more. it's so honest in the story it tells, and the way the music swells to tell it properly throughout the song is just amazing. i love this song, GOD!",4:12,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/a3/34/ac/a334acc6-5983-27ac-851d-8f03e148a4ce/25UMGIM99609.rgb.jpg
a7,disiz & theodora,melodrama,"there's just a particular way disiz writes heartbreak and yearning that i absolutely love. it's so heavy in images, it feels like a lullaby sometimes. this is another example of it—and its sound is so catchy yet entrancing, it's like a perfect pop song, but <em>more</em>. and then theodora comes in—showcasing the best of her ridiculously underrated writing, carrying the emotion with such impeccable care through her voice... this song is so, so special to me. it makes my guts twist and pull in a deliciously painful way. i love it so much.",2:56,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/1f/49/0d/1f490dc9-1e4d-7a91-f25a-086566f406e6/196873642161.jpg
a8,saint motel,hold my place in heaven,"this song is cinematic. it's so lush and immersive, so much so that it took me a while to even be able to describe just exactly what i love so much about it. it's dizzying to listen to—not just the way it is build, but the way it was mastered, shifting vocals from left to right and back, heightening that vertigo effect—but i can't get enough. ",2:44,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/72/4c/53/724c539e-1b29-5f54-39bb-2aa0a56f9bfa/075679627452.jpg
a9,hearts2hearts,focus,"this is one of the best executed house title tracks in k-pop in a hot minute. it's addicting, right from the first second. it's so good. it's sparkly and beautiful and catchy and will make you dance—and i know very little about hearts2hearts, but they sure can sing! they don't even sound like rookies on this track. the production work is absolutely stellar. oh my god i LOVE this song.",2:57,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/df/26/ea/df26eafa-06e8-8bd0-4180-5ba91fb91c39/888735953859.png
a10,milo j,gil,"<em>yein-yein, bere-yein-yein...</em> this was an introduction for me to the intricacy that is the argentinian accent i'm not gonna lie. BUT this song! my god. my gooodd. it's a crazy tale of hoping and dreaming and looking into the very core of love. god i don't even know what to say, you might really just have to listen to it, honestly.",3:54,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/f5/a6/33/f5a63325-8bd8-7e36-8850-878e2522169e/196873615486.jpg
a11,nct wish,melt inside my pocket,"there's something so refreshing about nct wish's entire discography. pure pop in the brightest, crispest sense. youthful and so contagious in its joy. <em>melt inside my pocket</em> fits in that, yes, but there's just something about it that is not only incredibly addicting but also so... neo. the runs, the cheek of the rap parts, it's so very neo while retaining that very wishfulness to it, there's no other way to describe it. i love you nct wish!!!!",3:11,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/41/07/aa/4107aa57-7d7e-5bdb-4d56-0c62b0ca49e0/888735951718.png
a12,bad bunny,BAILE INoLVIDABLE,"i cannot describe to you the first time i listened to this song—but the thrill i felt then, at the intro first and then, especially, once the salsa finally kicks in, haunts me everytime i've listened to it again since. what an incredible song. i think the moment i heard that song is when i knew <em>dtmf</em> as an album was about to change my life (and it did!). who knew one of the best yearning songs of the year would happen to be a salsa number by bad bunny that lasts just over six minutes. what a fucking time to be alive. ",6:08,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/90/5e/7e/905e7ed5-a8fa-a8f3-cd06-0028fdf3afaa/199066342442.jpg
a13,day6,"sun, stay asleep","on the same album, <em>inside out</em> has more plays than this song from me this year. however, i remember feeling precisely how this song grew on me—while i was taken by <em>inside out</em> when it came out by the catchiness of its chorus, <em>sun, stay asleep</em> has a bright, nostalgic quality to it that i feel grows the more you listen to it. it's not melancholic, though the lyrics are, just a little; maybe it does transpire through the music too, but it remains so stubbornly happy. may our beautiful, bright night never fade, may our love keep on going... the beauty of love in its fleeting nature can only be sustained by our own desire to hold onto it. god i love this song!",3:13,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/93/9f/05/939f0563-96d1-42df-a9ec-23ecc857eec6/8809928954691_Cover.jpg
a14,nmixx,papillon,"i was not aware of what the true meaning of mixxpop—nor the existence of it at all—was until i heard this. i've heard people tend to favour <em>slingshot (＜★)</em> in the album but to me, <em>papillon</em> was really the track that cemented the unicity of nmixx's sound. it pulls you in a trance and it's neaar haunting with its layered vocals and clipped sound effects. it's such a good song! thank you for making music fun again nmixx!!",2:38,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/b3/ac/c3/b3acc372-089f-e254-ce76-298ec6f2a2f0/8809928953823_Cover.jpg
a15,stray kids,phoenix,"this song was my favourite song off <em>karma</em> the first time i listened to the album. i ended up replaying some other songs more, but i still think that <em>phoenix</em> was one of the best executed tracks on the album, and one of the most interesting risks taken in terms of genre exploration. it does follow a very simple structure, unlike other really good tracks on the record like <em>half-time</em> (and i have a whole theory about this, but i'll leave it for another time) but it's SUCH a good song! and also one of the tracks that truly made me love felix's vocals so much. love you lee yongbok. you're doing great bestie. i love you stray kids! ",3:02,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/38/22/ee/3822ee8e-c8f6-bb12-10ca-dcfd27dd166b/8809928955230_Cover.jpg
a16,xdinary heroes,beautiful life,"<em>beautiful mind</em> was one of my favourite albums of the year in great part because of this song. i am the product of a teenage crisis lulled by green day's <em>american idiot</em> and my chemical romance's <em>the black parade</em>, so what a delight it was to hear a song inspired by songs like <em>jesus of suburbia</em>, <em>welcome to the black parade</em>, or most notably, queen's <em>bohemian rhapsody</em>... are you fucking kidding. i lost my mind hearing this. i loved every second i've listened to this song since this year. it's already longer than a typical k-pop title track, and i still wish it was longer (and to think it was originally around seven minutes... whatever). ",4:25,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/8c/45/ce/8c45ce0c-7b2f-cdff-161d-f67528914b3c/8809928953236_Cover.jpg
a17,ten,stunner,"yeah no wonder he went viral with this song. it's pop greatness at its peak. i've had hopes for ten's solo career for as long as i've been a fan of his and while nightwalker did execute some of them, i feel like they also reached a climax at <em>stunner</em>. could the mini have been better? yes. i can only hope the next album will be longer and more interesting, but as a single or title track, <em>stunner</em> quite literally... stuns. ",3:34,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/3a/28/34/3a28341e-b1b7-9a0d-0988-24e21c471e22/888735951558.png
a18,twice,right hand girl,"i drove through a red light because of this song. i can't wait for march 3rd, 2026 so i can see park jihyo perform this in front of my own two eyes. i have danced to this song so many fucking times it has become my most streamed twice song of the year. that's all.",2:31,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/b3/a8/e2/b3a8e208-ebd1-831e-4d00-2bdddd99f54a/8809928955766_Cover.jpg
a19,ateez (hongjoong),no1,"i'm writing this the day the music video for this song came out, with a whole different mix to the song featured in it. i only heard it once, so far—but i still think the original mix included in the album is my favourite, so far. i haven't kept as close an eye to ateez as i did once upon a time this year, but this song managed to keep me hooked enough to replay it again, and again, and again, and be rather bitter i missed hongjoong's dj set during the american leg of their tour this year (please give us a canadian date next time. please). i love hongjoong's personal work and artistry so much, and this was the best reminder i could ever hope to receive from him. what a fucking genius.",2:33,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/67/41/06/6741061b-db7d-dccb-6200-0be18e0a7cf8/196873101224.jpg
a20,theodora & luidji,go!,"before i was taken by <em>massoko na mabele</em>, the first track off <em>mega bbl</em> i was obsessed with was this one. and it's no wonder; i grew an unhealthy obsession with <em>saison 00</em> by luidji last year, and i was incredibly excited for this track when checking out the tracklist. and it did not disappoint! it's such a fun song, and another showcase of both their incredible versatility, but especially theodora's. god i love her so much. BOSS LADYYYYY!",2:27,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/97/bf/ca/97bfca44-9e03-06cb-e0bb-65cc94e3d153/25UMGIM62999.rgb.jpg
