a1,bad bunny,VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,"SONG OF THE MOTHERFUCKING YEAR. listen. listeeeeennn. yes, there are better songs on <em>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</em>. songs that are longer, that are better produced, that tell a more impactful story. as we've established, the album is a feat in music and artistry like no other artist has even pretended to attain this year. but this song... it's so fucking catchy, it will put me in a good mood literally no matter how i feel, it makes me want to dance and sing and god i don't even know why i'm so hyped about what is quite literally just a simple reggaeton song but it's so good guys. it's crazy.",2:36,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/90/5e/7e/905e7ed5-a8fa-a8f3-cd06-0028fdf3afaa/199066342442.jpg
a2,ino casablanca,bissap du 20ème,"le nombre de fois que j'ai chanté cette chanson depuis sa sortie bro. <em>quitte à me mettre la mif à dos... j'traînais en bas chaque día...</em> it's the perfect balance of catchy, fun, and thoughtful; it's a stellar example of what a good raï song should be without falling into boring, redone clichés, that seem to gain a sick popularity these days. not that i don't eat it up sometimes—i'm a sucker for a good fucking beat!!!—but this feels so genuine and real. i love this song bro. FUCK",3:37,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/a9/dd/5d/a9dd5dce-8926-fe8f-a37e-8a99c9a4142e/5026854040271.jpg
a3,theodora & thisizlondon,masoko na mabele,"fuck i don't even know how to describe this song. it's addictive and it will make you shake your ass. i find theodora's music nearly bewitching with the way she embodies her persona through her songs, as well as the insane way her songs sound. thisizlondon is someone i discovered through this track and i'm already excited to hear more from him... and now we even have a music video for this song. god fucking bless. ",2:57,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/97/bf/ca/97bfca44-9e03-06cb-e0bb-65cc94e3d153/25UMGIM62999.rgb.jpg
a4,lou-adriane cassidy,dis-moi dis-moi dis-moi,"this song won chanson de l'année at this year's adisq gala. i usually rarely care for adisq as i find that the ""quebec"" culture it portrays is awfully limited and ridiculously fucking white, for a cultural landscape—especially in music—that has drastically changed in the past decades, in the past five years even more. but this song is actually stellar, and deserving of its praise. i find the rest of the album to fall a little short, as good as it remains, but this song? please listen to it. it's indie pop at its finest, it is so poignant, i love it so much. oh my god. i think it came out in 2024 technically but honestly i don't care. it belongs here.",5:10,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/90/ca/9e/90ca9ebf-6ff0-c6c1-1cb0-7a21107f43f7/cover.jpg
a5,stray kids,divine,"kim seungmin you are the vocalist of the century. non mais sans blague—i have to be honest, as much as i absolutely love skz, none of their releases up until that point, this year, had led me to believe they would ever drop something like <em>divine</em>. i think some of the best songs of theirs, this year and overall, are the ones where you can feel them taking risks, playing around with sounds and bending genres to the limits of their desires. and while some other tracks managed that on <em>karma</em> (my beautiful, beautiful <em>half-time</em>), i feel like <em>divine</em> did it SO well. i felt that the first moment i heard the song and it reminded me exactly of why i have been obsessed with this stupid band's music since the fucking pandemic and then again this year hello!!! i love this song!!!!!!",3:07,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/72/33/69/7233691c-aefe-252d-678b-faa9b3455200/8809928958965_Cover.jpg
a6,chappell roan,the subway,"they don't make songs like these anymore... you can belt it, you can silently weep to it, you can sing along as you drive home in the dead of the night some winter night, and it will always hit the same. chappell roan has such a hypnotic voice, and i absolutely love the way she writes. this song really shows exactly that, and more. it's so honest in the story it tells, and the way the music swells to tell it properly throughout the song is just amazing. i love this song, GOD!",4:12,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/a3/34/ac/a334acc6-5983-27ac-851d-8f03e148a4ce/25UMGIM99609.rgb.jpg
a7,disiz & theodora,melodrama,"there's just a particular way disiz writes heartbreak and yearning that i absolutely love. it's so heavy in images, it feels like a lullaby sometimes. this is another example of it—and its sound is so catchy yet entrancing, it's like a perfect pop song, but <em>more</em>. and then theodora comes in—showcasing the best of her ridiculously underrated writing, carrying the emotion with such impeccable care through her voice... this song is so, so special to me. it makes my guts twist and pull in a deliciously painful way. i love it so much.",2:56,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/1f/49/0d/1f490dc9-1e4d-7a91-f25a-086566f406e6/196873642161.jpg
a8,saint motel,hold my place in heaven,"this song is cinematic. it's so lush and immersive, so much so that it took me a while to even be able to describe just exactly what i love so much about it. it's dizzying to listen to—not just the way it is build, but the way it was mastered, shifting vocals from left to right and back, heightening that vertigo effect—but i can't get enough. ",2:44,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/72/4c/53/724c539e-1b29-5f54-39bb-2aa0a56f9bfa/075679627452.jpg
a9,hearts2hearts,focus,"this is one of the best executed house title tracks in k-pop in a hot minute. it's addicting, right from the first second. it's so good. it's sparkly and beautiful and catchy and will make you dance—and i know very little about hearts2hearts, but they sure can sing! they don't even sound like rookies on this track. the production work is absolutely stellar. oh my god i LOVE this song.",2:57,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music221/v4/df/26/ea/df26eafa-06e8-8bd0-4180-5ba91fb91c39/888735953859.png
a10,milo j,gil,"<em>yein-yein, bere-yein-yein...</em> this was an introduction for me to the intricacy that is the argentinian accent i'm not gonna lie. BUT this song! my god. my gooodd. it's a crazy tale of hoping and dreaming and looking into the very core of love. god i don't even know what to say, you might really just have to listen to it, honestly.",3:54,https://a1.mzstatic.com/r40/Music211/v4/f5/a6/33/f5a63325-8bd8-7e36-8850-878e2522169e/196873615486.jpg
